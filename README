# What is Bee

This component allows you to wrap an element (such as a button) and preempt the click with a call to the collection site

## Why Bee?
Bees collect pollen and bring it back to the hive (mmm... honey)

# How to build
First install all deps by running `npm install`

Run `npm run build` to build the library with rollup

# How to test

Testing requires building another site that uses this component

1. Create a new sample project such as `npm init vite@latest test-app -- --template react-ts`
1. Install all deps in this new project by running `npm install`
1. Go into the `bee` directory and run `npm link`
1. Go into the `test-app` directory and run `npm link bee`
1. Create sample code that uses the component such as the following in `App.tsx`. Then run it with `npm run dev`


```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import './App.css'
import Collector from 'bee'; //<-- we're testing this

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <Collector>
          <button onClick={() => { setCount(count + 1)}}>
            Increment
          </button>
        </Collector>
        Count: {count}
      </div>
    </>
  )
}

export default App
```
